# Loan_Classification

This project uses a loan dataset from Kaggle website initialized by Wendy Kan and maintained by Kaggle team. The dataset contains all the loan records issued by Lending Club from 2007 to 2019 with the current loan status, including “Fully Paid” “Charged Off” “Default” and so on. This loan dataset has 2.26 million records with 145 attribute columns, which consists of loan amount, term, installment, grade, employment length, home ownership, annual income and collections among others. For classification algorithm needs, this paper divides each loan records into two classes based on their loan status. Records with “Fully Paid” status are converted into “Good” class and records with “Charged Off” or “Default” are converted into “Bad” class. The majority records (262447) in the dataset are in “Good” class and the minority records (1043940) are negative “Bad” class. It is no doubt that the ratio between two classes is imbalanced.
